## Improvement Opportunities

### **Priority 1: Tool Selection Refinement**
**Issue**: Over-selection of `property_info` tool
**Solution**: Enhance tool selection criteria in agent prompt
```yaml
property_info:
  use_when: "Guest asks specifically about facilities, hours, policies, or amenities"
  avoid_when: "Request is about booking specific services or experiences"
```

### **Priority 2: Response Time Optimization**
**Current**: 15.9s average
**Target**: <10s average  
**Approaches**:
- Parallel tool execution where possible
- Optimized prompt engineering
- Streaming responses for better perceived performance

### **Priority 3: Complex Scenario Handling**
**Issue**: Cultural experience scenario missed `reservation` tool
**Solution**: Improve multi-step reasoning for experiences requiring booking
