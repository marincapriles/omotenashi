# Design Decisions Log - Omotenashi Prototype v0.1

## Overview

This document tracks key design decisions, assumptions, and rationale for the Omotenashi prototype v0.1 implementation.

---

## Decision 1: BDI Framework Implementation

**Date**: Initial Design Phase  
**Decision**: Implement BDI (Beliefs, Desires, Intentions) as configuration-driven data structures rather than complex logical reasoning system  
**Rationale**:

- Prototype focus requires simple, working implementation
- Configuration-based approach allows easy modification of agent personality
- Avoids complexity of formal BDI logical reasoning engines
- Enables clear traceability of agent behavior to BDI principles  
  **Alternatives Considered**: Formal logic-based BDI implementation, rule-based systems  
  **Impact**: Simplified development, easier testing, limited to pre-defined behavioral patterns

---

## Decision 2: Tool System Architecture

**Date**: Initial Design Phase  
**Decision**: Mock all external integrations with simulated data and responses  
**Rationale**:

- PRD specifies research prototype, not production system
- Eliminates external dependencies and potential integration complexities
- Allows focus on agent reasoning and interaction patterns
- Faster development and testing cycles  
  **Alternatives Considered**: Real API integrations, hybrid mock/real approach  
  **Impact**: Fully functional demo without external constraints, limited real-world applicability

---

## Decision 3: LangGraph Workflow Design

**Date**: Initial Design Phase  
**Decision**: Start with linear workflow, add complexity iteratively  
**Rationale**:

- Follows PRD principle of iterative development
- LangGraph can be complex for first implementation
- Linear flow easier to debug and understand
- Can evolve to complex multi-node graphs in future versions  
  **Alternatives Considered**: Complex multi-branch workflow from start  
  **Impact**: Faster initial implementation, may require refactoring for advanced features

---

## Decision 4: Memory Implementation

**Date**: Initial Design Phase  
**Decision**: In-memory conversation history with simple state persistence  
**Rationale**:

- Prototype doesn't require persistent storage across sessions
- Simple implementation aligns with development principles
- Sufficient for demonstrating agent memory capabilities
- Avoids database setup and management complexity  
  **Alternatives Considered**: File-based persistence, database storage  
  **Impact**: Limited to single session memory, simpler development and testing

---

## Decision 5: CLI Interface Choice

**Date**: Initial Design Phase  
**Decision**: Use Click framework for CLI implementation  
**Rationale**:

- Mature, well-documented Python CLI framework
- Supports complex command structures if needed later
- Good integration with Python ecosystem
- Provides professional CLI experience  
  **Alternatives Considered**: Typer, argparse, custom implementation  
  **Impact**: Professional CLI interface, dependency on external framework

---

## Decision 6: Response Format Structure

**Date**: Initial Design Phase  
**Decision**: Structured response format with separate fields for message, tools used, and reasoning  
**Rationale**:

- PRD explicitly requires showing tools used and reasoning
- Clear separation makes debugging easier
- Enables programmatic analysis of agent behavior
- Supports transparency requirements for research prototype  
  **Alternatives Considered**: Single unstructured response, JSON format  
  **Impact**: Verbose output, clear traceability of agent decisions

---

## Decision 7: Omotenashi Principle Integration

**Date**: Initial Design Phase  
**Decision**: Embed Omotenashi principles as explicit beliefs in BDI profile and reference in reasoning  
**Rationale**:

- PRD requires BDI profile based on Omotenashi concept
- Explicit principles make agent behavior traceable
- Enables validation that responses align with hospitality expectations
- Provides clear grounding for agent personality  
  **Alternatives Considered**: Implicit training, separate principle system  
  **Impact**: Clear cultural grounding, requires manual curation of principles

---

## Decision 8: Error Handling Strategy

**Date**: Initial Design Phase  
**Decision**: Graceful degradation with informative error messages  
**Rationale**:

- Research prototype should be robust for demonstration
- Clear error messages aid in debugging and user understanding
- Prevents system crashes during demos
- Aligns with hospitality theme of maintaining service quality  
  **Alternatives Considered**: Fail-fast approach, silent error handling  
  **Impact**: More robust demo experience, additional code complexity

---

## Decision 9: Configuration Management

**Date**: Initial Design Phase  
**Decision**: YAML-based configuration files for BDI profiles and tool definitions  
**Rationale**:

- Human-readable format for easy modification
- Supports comments for documentation
- Industry standard for configuration
- Enables non-developers to modify agent behavior  
  **Alternatives Considered**: JSON, Python files, environment variables  
  **Impact**: Easy configuration management, YAML parsing dependency

---

## Decision 10: Testing Approach

**Date**: Initial Design Phase  
**Decision**: Focus on integration tests over unit tests for prototype  
**Rationale**:

- Prototype emphasizes working end-to-end functionality
- Integration tests validate user experience
- Limited development time should focus on core functionality
- Unit tests more valuable for production systems  
  **Alternatives Considered**: Comprehensive unit test coverage, no formal testing  
  **Impact**: Faster feedback on user experience, potential gaps in component testing

---

## Decision 11: Anthropic API Integration

**Date**: Initial Design Phase  
**Decision**: Direct API calls to Claude 3.5 Sonnet rather than using LangChain's Anthropic integration  
**Rationale**:

- PRD specifically mentions Anthropic API with Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Direct integration provides more control over API parameters
- Reduces dependency chain complexity
- Easier to debug API interactions  
  **Alternatives Considered**: LangChain Anthropic integration, other LLM providers  
  **Impact**: Simpler integration, manual handling of API features

---

## Decision 12: Project Structure

**Date**: Initial Design Phase  
**Decision**: Modular structure with clear separation of concerns (agent, tools, workflow, cli)  
**Rationale**:

- PRD emphasizes rigorous commenting and understandability
- Modular structure makes code easier to navigate and understand
- Supports iterative development approach
- Enables testing of individual components  
  **Alternatives Considered**: Monolithic structure, framework-driven structure  
  **Impact**: Clear code organization, slightly more complex imports and setup

## Assumptions Made

### Technical Assumptions

1. **Python Environment**: Assumes Python 3.9+ environment with pip package management
2. **Network Access**: Requires internet connection for Anthropic API calls
3. **API Availability**: Assumes stable Anthropic API service during development and demo
4. **Resource Constraints**: Assumes sufficient API quota for development and testing

### Business Assumptions

1. **User Expertise**: CLI users have basic command-line familiarity
2. **Use Case Scope**: Limited to luxury hospitality scenarios defined in BDI profile
3. **Demo Context**: Primarily for research and demonstration purposes
4. **Data Requirements**: Mock data sufficient for prototype validation

### Design Assumptions

2. **Session Scope**: Conversations don't need to persist across application restarts
3. **Tool Reliability**: Mock tools always succeed (no failure simulation)
4. **Language Support**: English-only interface and responses
