# Operations Manager Enhancements - Property Manager Value Proposition

## Executive Summary
This proposal enhances the Operations Manager to provide proactive value to property managers through bidirectional workflows, enabling property managers to initiate actions that flow through Operations Manager to Concierge to guests.

## High-Value Property Manager Workflows

### 1. **Proactive Guest Communications**
Property managers often need to communicate important information to guests:
- Maintenance notifications (e.g., "Pool maintenance 2-4 PM tomorrow")
- Special events or opportunities (e.g., "Wine tasting event tonight")
- Weather alerts or safety information
- Service disruptions or changes

### 2. **VIP Guest Management**
- Alert concierge about incoming VIP guests
- Special amenity preparations
- Personalized welcome arrangements
- Priority handling instructions

### 3. **Operational Directives**
- Room inventory updates affecting guest upgrades
- Special dietary accommodations for events
- Staff scheduling changes affecting services
- Emergency procedures or drills

### 4. **Revenue Opportunities**
- Last-minute availability for premium services
- Special promotions or packages
- Upsell opportunities based on guest profile
- Event tickets or exclusive experiences

## Enhanced Architecture - Bidirectional Flow
